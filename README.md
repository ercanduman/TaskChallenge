# Task Challenge

This is demo project created based on below tasks.

For all tasks you can use **standard Java** and **NO** additional frameworks or **libs** are needed!


#### Task 1: Native Android:

- Create an activity which loads data from this URL (use **plain java**!)
  - https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums
- Find a way to render the JSON into a view, which is scrollable


#### Task 2: Android Services
- Build a BroadcastReceiver that listens to USER_PRESENT Intent
- Implement a background task (JobScheduler or background service) that runs periodically
- Every time the background task runs, create a push notification that shows the user how long the phone was active since the Intent was triggered
